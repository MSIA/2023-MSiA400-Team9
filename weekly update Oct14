Our plan for the next few weeks:
10/14 - begin reading in tables, set up GitHub repository
10/ 21 - complete reading in tables, continue cleaning data
10/28 - continue cleaning / tidying data
11/4 - complete cleaning / tidying data, begin EDA
Update, w/o 10/10:
This week, we began the process of reading in tables to the PostgreSQL server. At the moment, we have somewhat successfully loaded most tables (deptinfo, skuinfo, sksinfo, and strinfo). We ran into some issues with the SKU table, due to some rows/products having two colors separated by a comma. This resulted in an extra column in those rows when delimiting with commas, but we were able to overcome this by first excluding those rows. In the future, we might fix those rows (by removing the comma and space separating each of the two colors, ex: “red, blue” becomes “redblue”) and then appending them to the current tables. We expect to finish reading in that last transactions (trnsact) table in the next few days.

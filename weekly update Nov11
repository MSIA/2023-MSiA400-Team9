Our plan for the next few weeks:
11/11 - wrap up EDA, continue feature engineering, connect server data to ipynb
11/18 - wrap up feature engineering, begin building models
11/25 - begin model assessment / selection

Update, w/o 11/11:
This week, we wrapped up EDA. We will be using factors from the transactions table and the sku + store table, 
with the target variable being the new binary variable we created (the one that compares original price and retail price, 
with situations where orgprice > retail = 1). We have fetched the data from the server, loaded it into an ipynb, 
and saved it as a csv (because querying from the server takes hours each time).
More feature engineering might be necessary, dependent upon the model types we choose, as well as performance. We aim to start building preliminary classification models next week.

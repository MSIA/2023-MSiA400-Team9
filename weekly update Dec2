Our plan for the next few weeks:
12/2 - wrap up modeling
12/9 - submit project

Update, w/o 12/2:
This week, we made some pretty big changes:
   > Our "discount" is now the mean percentage per SKU
   > We are now using ~1.5 million rows of data from SKU, such as color, brand, department, etc. to predict the expected percentage discount for these products
We have also done a lot of new cleaning / feature engineering:
   > Grouping colors
   > Creating quintiles to better identify brands / reduce length of dummy variables
We are currently in the process of wrapping up modeling, and will begin preparing our report and presentation.
